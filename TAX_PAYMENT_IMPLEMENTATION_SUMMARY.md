✅ **Challan capture with file upload**
✅ **Export blocking until payment complete**
✅ **Static payment instructions provided**
✅ **Database persistence of challan data**
✅ **Integration with tax computation engine**

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend Components

#### Challan API (`apps/api/routers/challan.py`)
- **Payment Summary Endpoint** - `/api/challan/payment-summary/{return_id}`
  - Calculates tax liability using comprehensive tax engine
  - Shows TDS, advance tax, net payable, and interest breakdown
  - Indicates challan presence and remaining balance
  
- **Challan Upload Endpoint** - `/api/challan/upload/{return_id}`
  - Accepts CIN/CRN, BSR code, bank reference, payment date, amount
  - Supports PDF file upload (max 10MB)
  - Validates file type and prevents duplicate uploads
  
- **Challan Retrieval** - `/api/challan/{return_id}`
  - Gets existing challan details for a return
  - Returns null if no challan exists
  
- **File Download** - `/api/challan/download/{return_id}`
  - Downloads uploaded challan PDF file
  - Proper file serving with correct headers

#### Database Schema (`apps/api/schemas/challan.py`)
- **ChallanCreate** - Input validation for challan upload
- **ChallanResponse** - Structured challan data response
- **TaxPaymentSummary** - Complete tax payment breakdown

#### Export Validation (`apps/api/routers/returns.py`)
- **Export Endpoint** - `/api/returns/{return_id}/export`
  - Validates tax computation is complete
  - Blocks export if tax payable and no challan
  - Verifies challan amount covers liability
  - Returns detailed error messages for missing requirements

### Frontend Components

#### Tax Payment Page (`apps/web/src/routes/TaxPayment.tsx`)
- **Conditional Display** - Only shows when net tax payable > 0
- **Tax Summary Card** - Complete breakdown of tax liability and payments
- **Payment Instructions** - Static markdown instructions for NSDL/bank payment
- **Challan Upload Form** - Captures all required challan details
- **File Upload** - PDF upload with validation and size limits
- **Existing Challan Display** - Shows uploaded challan details with download option

#### Review Integration (`apps/web/src/routes/Review.tsx`)
- **Dynamic Navigation** - Shows "Pay Tax" button when payable > 0
- **Amount Display** - Shows exact payable amount in button
- **Conditional Flow** - Routes to payment page or continues to next step

## 📊 Tax Payment Features

  - Total Tax Liability: Computed using tax engine
  - TDS Paid: From return data
  - Advance Tax Paid: From return data
  - Net Payable: Liability minus payments
  - Interest 234A/B/C: Calculated by tax engine
  - Total Amount Due: Tax + Interest
```

### Challan Data Capture
```yaml
Required Fields:
  - CIN/CRN: 16-digit challan identification number
  - BSR Code: 7-digit bank BSR code

  - If net payable <= 0:
    - No challan required: ✅ Allowed
```
