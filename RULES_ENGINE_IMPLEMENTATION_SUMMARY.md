## üìä Rule Expression Language

### Supported Operations
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`

- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Functions**: `min()`, `max()`, `abs()`, `round()`
- **Conditionals**: `if-else` expressions

### Example Expressions
```yaml
# Simple comparison
expression: "deduction_80c <= 150000"

# Conditional logic
expression: "deduction_80d_parents <= (50000 if parents_senior_citizen else 25000)"

# Complex calculation
expression: "total_income == 0 or tax_liability / max(total_income, 1) <= 0.45"

# Multiple conditions
expression: "total_income <= 700000 and tax_regime == 'new'"
```
